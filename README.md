## Application Description
The Gesture Volume Control is build using:

    1.OpenCv
    2.Google's open to work library Mediapipe
    3.Another open module Pycaw for manipulating the volume of the system



I build a module named HandsDetectionModule which keep tracks of the hand and fingers and gives us the position of the fingers.

This module is then used in the program for manipulating the volume level using the distance of the tips of the index finger and the thumb.
